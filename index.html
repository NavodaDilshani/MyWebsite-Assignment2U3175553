            Churhchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of A ustralia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s rst brutalist building. Sev eral components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed. Although it has undergone some alterations o ver the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large ar eas of blank wall and use o-form concrete, sloping structural ns and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast ns for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Oces, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.

 Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
                     
                     <br><br>
 - Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing. 
                     <br><br>
 - O-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing <br>and the spandrels to the south and east wings.
                     <br><br>
 In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural ns, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast ns for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended oce use.
 The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.
 Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
